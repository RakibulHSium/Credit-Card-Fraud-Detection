## Project Description

Credit card fraud is a serious concern for both consumers and financial institutions. Detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time is crucial to minimize financial losses and protect customers. This project addresses this issue by developing a machine learning model that can identify fraudulent credit card transactions based on historical transaction data.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing credit card transaction records. The dataset includes features such as transaction amount, transaction time, and various anonymized features derived from credit card transactions. It also includes a binary target variable indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

## Installation

To run the Credit Card Fraud Detection project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
2. Data Preprocessing: Before training the model, you may need to preprocess the dataset. This includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.

3. Model Training: Train the fraud detection model using one of the available algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forest, or deep learning. You can find example code in the train_model.py script.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Inference: Use the trained model to predict whether a given credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.

6. Deployment: For real-world applications, consider deploying the model as a service or integrating it into your existing systems.
